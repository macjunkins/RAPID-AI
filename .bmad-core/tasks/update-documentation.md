# Update Documentation Task

## Purpose

To guide systematic updates to project documentation following identification of gaps or changes in functionality. This task ensures documentation updates are comprehensive, accurate, and maintain consistency across all documentation files.

## Prerequisites

- Documentation gap analysis from validate-documentation-currency task
- Understanding of changes that require documentation updates
- Access to relevant project files and implementation details

## Process

### 1. Review Update Requirements

Analyze documentation update needs from various sources:

- **Gap Analysis Results**: Issues identified during documentation validation
- **Development Changes**: Recent code changes requiring documentation updates
- **User Feedback**: Reported documentation issues or unclear sections
- **Process Changes**: Updated workflows or procedures needing documentation

### 2. Plan Documentation Updates

For each identified update requirement:

#### Scope Definition
- Identify specific documentation files to update
- Determine sections within files that need changes
- Assess impact on related documentation files
- Plan for consistency across multiple documentation sources

#### Content Planning
- Define what new content needs to be created
- Identify existing content that needs modification
- Plan removal of obsolete or incorrect content
- Ensure updated content aligns with current implementation
- **AI-Assisted Content Generation**: Use AI analysis to generate suggested documentation content
- **AI-Powered Gap Analysis**: Leverage AI to identify documentation gaps and improvement opportunities

#### Coordination Planning
- Identify dependencies between documentation updates
- Plan update sequence to maintain documentation consistency
- Coordinate with development team for technical accuracy
- Schedule reviews and validation steps

### 3. Execute Documentation Updates

#### Content Creation and Modification

**For New Features:**
- Create comprehensive feature documentation
- Include usage examples and common scenarios
- Add configuration and setup instructions
- Document integration points and dependencies

**For Changed Features:**
- Update existing documentation to reflect changes
- Modify examples to use current syntax/procedures
- Update screenshots or diagrams as needed
- Revise troubleshooting information for new behavior

**For Removed Features:**
- Remove obsolete documentation sections
- Update navigation and cross-references
- Add migration guidance if applicable
- Archive deprecated information appropriately

#### Documentation Standards Compliance

Ensure all updates follow project documentation standards:

- **Style Guide Compliance**: Consistent formatting, tone, and structure
- **Technical Accuracy**: Verified against actual implementation
- **Completeness**: All necessary information included
- **Clarity**: Information presented in user-friendly manner

### 4. Cross-Reference Updates

Update related documentation to maintain consistency:

- **Navigation Updates**: Table of contents, index pages, menu structures
- **Link Updates**: Internal and external references
- **Cross-References**: Related sections and dependencies
- **Integration Points**: How updated content relates to other documentation

### 5. Quality Assurance

Perform comprehensive quality checks on updated documentation:

#### Content Review
- Verify technical accuracy against implementation
- Check examples and code snippets work correctly
- Validate procedures can be followed successfully
- Ensure language is clear and appropriate for audience

#### Consistency Review
- Check formatting consistency across files
- Verify terminology usage is consistent
- Ensure navigation and structure are logical
- Validate cross-references are accurate

#### User Experience Review
- Test documentation from user perspective
- Verify information flow is logical
- Check that common use cases are covered
- Ensure troubleshooting information is helpful

### 6. Validation and Testing

Test updated documentation thoroughly:

#### Functional Testing
- Execute documented procedures to verify accuracy
- Test all code examples and configuration instructions
- Validate links and references work correctly
- Confirm screenshots and diagrams are current

#### User Acceptance Testing
- Have team members review documentation for clarity
- Test documentation with users unfamiliar with changes
- Gather feedback on usability and completeness
- Iterate based on feedback received

## Output Requirements

### Updated Documentation Files

Deliver comprehensive, updated documentation including:

- **Revised Content**: All identified gaps and issues addressed
- **New Content**: Documentation for new features and capabilities
- **Improved Structure**: Enhanced organization and navigation
- **Quality Assurance**: Thoroughly tested and validated content

### Update Summary

Provide summary of changes made:

- **Files Modified**: List of all documentation files updated
- **Changes Made**: Summary of modifications for each file
- **New Content**: Description of newly created documentation
- **Validation Results**: Confirmation that updates work correctly

### Maintenance Plan

Establish ongoing maintenance approach:

- **Review Schedule**: Regular validation and update cycles
- **Update Triggers**: Conditions that require documentation updates
- **Responsibility Assignment**: Who maintains which documentation
- **Quality Standards**: Ongoing standards for documentation quality

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Pre-Release Updates

Ensure documentation updates are completed before releases:

- New feature documentation complete and validated
- Changed functionality properly documented
- Migration guides available for breaking changes
- User-facing changes have appropriate documentation

### Continuous Maintenance

Establish process for ongoing documentation maintenance:

- Regular reviews to identify documentation drift
- Automatic triggers for documentation updates
- Integration with development workflow
- Feedback collection and response process

## Quality Criteria

Documentation updates are complete when:

- All identified gaps have been addressed
- New and changed functionality is accurately documented
- Examples and procedures have been tested and validated
- Cross-references and navigation are updated and working
- Documentation passes user acceptance testing
- Content meets project documentation standards

## Tools and Support

Leverage available tools for documentation updates:

- **AI Analysis Tools**: For automated documentation gap analysis and content suggestions
- **Documentation Generators**: For API docs and reference materials
- **Screenshot Tools**: For current interface documentation
- **Link Checkers**: To validate internal and external references
- **Review Tools**: For collaborative editing and feedback collection
- **Testing Frameworks**: For validating code examples and procedures

### AI Integration for Documentation

Use AI tools to enhance documentation quality and efficiency:

- **Content Analysis**: AI comparison of documentation vs implementation
- **Gap Detection**: Automated identification of missing documentation
- **Content Suggestions**: AI-generated suggestions for documentation improvements
- **Consistency Checking**: AI validation of terminology and style consistency

## Integration Points

Coordinate documentation updates with:

- **Development Team**: For technical accuracy and implementation details
- **QA Team**: For testing scenarios and validation procedures
- **Product Team**: For user experience and feature prioritization
- **Release Management**: For timing and coordination with releases

This task ensures that documentation updates are systematic, comprehensive, and maintain the high quality standards expected from professional development processes.
