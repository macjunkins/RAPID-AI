# RAPID-AI 2.0 - Structured Execution Framework PRD
# Major architectural pivot from conversational workflows to execution-focused structured data

product:
  name: "RAPID-AI 2.0"
  tagline: "Execution-focused AI development framework"
  version: "2.0.0"

  vision: |
    Transform AI-assisted development from conversational overhead to deterministic execution.
    Conversation for ideation and exploration. Structured data for implementation and execution.

  philosophy:
    core_principle: "Conversation doesn't scale for execution - structured data removes ambiguity"
    use_cases:
      ideation:
        description: "Natural conversation for exploration, brainstorming, architectural decisions"
        format: "Conversational AI (like this interaction)"
        value: "High - teases out ideas, challenges assumptions, explores options"
        token_cost: "High but worth it - this is creative work"
      execution:
        description: "Deterministic code generation from structured specifications"
        format: "YAML/JSON input → Code output"
        value: "Maximum efficiency - no interpretation, just implementation"
        token_cost: "Minimal - 50-70% token savings vs conversational"

  target_users:
    - type: "Solo developers"
      needs: ["Fast iteration", "Minimal token usage", "No AI conversation overhead"]
    - type: "Small development teams"
      needs: ["Repeatable workflows", "Consistent outputs", "Version-controlled specs"]
    - type: "AI-augmented developers"
      needs: ["Claude for reasoning", "CoPilot for speed", "Deterministic execution"]

  status: "draft"
  replaces: "docs/prd.md (v1.0 brownfield enhancement)"
  reason_for_v2: |
    Major course correction from conversational BMAD-style agents to execution-focused
    structured workflows. V1.0 focused on incremental enhancement with markdown outputs.
    V2.0 is a fundamental architectural pivot to YAML-first deterministic execution.

problem_statement:
  current_industry_antipattern: |
    Developer: "Build user authentication"
    AI: "Great! Can you tell me more about your requirements?"
    Developer: "Email and password login"
    AI: "Would you like OAuth integration too?"
    ...
    [15 messages later, 20K tokens burned]
    AI: "Here's your code!"

  token_inefficiency: |
    Markdown-based workflows force AI to:
    1. Parse natural language (500-800 tokens)
    2. Interpret architectural terms (1K tokens)
    3. Infer file structure from prose (800 tokens)
    4. Generate code (2K tokens)
    Total: ~4.3K tokens per story

  rapid_ai_v1_limitations:
    - conversational_overhead: "BMAD agents require back-and-forth dialogue"
    - markdown_ambiguity: "AI must parse prose to extract structure"
    - copilot_only: "Limited to CoPilot CLI - can't leverage Claude's reasoning"
    - documentation_ceremony: "Doc-as-you-go in markdown adds friction without clear ROI"
    - better-documentation_ceremony: "Users are developers who read code for a living. yaml is fine"

solution_overview:
  yaml_first_architecture: |
    All AI inputs and outputs use structured YAML:
    - PRD: Product requirements in queryable YAML structure
    - Epics: Sharded epic files (docs/prd/epic-{n}.yaml)
    - Stories: Individual story specs (docs/stories/{epic}-{story}-story.yaml)
    - Architecture: Technical decisions in structured format

  dual_ai_strategy:
    claude_cli:
      usage: "Discovery, analysis, architectural reasoning"
      strength: "Superior reasoning and architectural thinking"
      command: "claude -p 'prompt'"
    copilot_cli:
      usage: "Fast code generation, boilerplate, simple tasks"
      strength: "Speed and simplicity"
      command: "copilot -p 'prompt'"

  execution_workflow:
    ideation_phase:
      mode: "Conversational"
      example: "What should this feature do? How should I architect it?"
      output: "High-level decisions documented in YAML"
    analysis_phase:
      mode: "Structured (Claude CLI)"
      input: "Epic context + feature description"
      output: "story.yaml (structured specification)"
      token_cost: "Moderate (one-time analysis)"
    implementation_phase:
      mode: "Execution (no conversation)"
      input: "story.yaml"
      output: "Code files"
      token_cost: "Minimal (deterministic)"

# Risks and Mitigation

risks:
  - risk: "AI fails to generate valid YAML structure"
    impact: "High - blocks entire workflow"
    probability: "Medium"
    mitigation: |
      - Include schema definition inline in AI prompts
      - Implement iterative validation with hints
      - Fallback to template-based YAML generation
      - Test with both Claude and CoPilot to identify which works better

  - risk: "YAML is harder to read/edit than markdown"
    impact: "Medium - developer experience suffers"
    probability: "Low"
    mitigation: |
      - VS Code YAML extension provides auto-completion
      - Schema validation catches errors during editing
      - Optional markdown generation for human review
      - Focus on querying YAML, not manual editing

  - risk: "Claude CLI subscription required adds cost"
    impact: "Medium - adoption barrier"
    probability: "High"
    mitigation: |
      - CoPilot remains fully functional as fallback
      - Document cost/benefit of Claude subscription
      - Allow mixed AI usage (Claude for discovery, CoPilot for rest)

  - risk: "EmberCare backward compatibility breaks"
    impact: "Critical - production app affected"
    probability: "Low"
    mitigation: |
      - Maintain markdown support during transition
      - Test EmberCare compatibility before each commit
      - Feature flag for YAML vs markdown workflows
      - Rollback plan documented and tested

# Open Questions

open_questions:
  - question: "Should we auto-generate markdown from YAML for GitHub readability?"
    context: "YAML is machine-readable, markdown is human-readable on GitHub"
    options:
      - option: "Generate both .yaml and .md from same AI output"
        pros: ["Best of both worlds", "GitHub previews work"]
        cons: ["Sync issues if manually edited", "Extra files"]
      - option: "YAML only, no markdown generation"
        pros: ["Single source of truth", "No sync issues"]
        cons: ["GitHub preview shows raw YAML", "Less readable"]
      - option: "YAML primary, markdown on-demand"
        pros: ["YAML for AI, markdown when needed", "Explicit generation"]
        cons: ["Extra step for markdown", "Possible to forget"]
    recommendation: "Start with YAML-only, add markdown generation if users request it"

  - question: "How to handle documentation workflow features in YAML-first world?"
    context: "V1.0 added doc-detection and verification - keep or remove?"
    options:
      - option: "Remove documentation workflow entirely"
        pros: ["Reduces ceremony", "Simpler codebase"]
        cons: ["Loses systematic doc verification"]
      - option: "Keep but simplify to YAML-based tracking"
        pros: ["Documentation currency still valuable", "Adapts to YAML"]
        cons: ["Additional complexity"]
    recommendation: "Remove for MVP, revisit after YAML workflows proven"

  - question: "Should RAPID-AI 2.0 break EmberCare compatibility for clean start?"
    context: "EmberCare uses markdown workflows - migrate or maintain parallel?"
    options:
      - option: "Break compatibility - RAPID-AI 2.0 is YAML-only"
        pros: ["Clean architecture", "No legacy code"]
        cons: ["EmberCare must migrate", "Risk of breaking production"]
      - option: "Maintain parallel markdown support during transition"
        pros: ["EmberCare unaffected", "Gradual migration"]
        cons: ["Code complexity", "Two workflows to maintain"]
    recommendation: "Maintain parallel support with feature flag - migrate EmberCare incrementally"
