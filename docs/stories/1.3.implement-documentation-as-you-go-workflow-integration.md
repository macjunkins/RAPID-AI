# Story 1.3: Implement Documentation-as-You-Go Workflow Integration

## Status: Approved

## Story

**As a** developer completing development tasks using RAPID-AI,
**I want** documentation to be automatically updated as part of the development workflow,
**so that** user documentation stays current and task completion includes documentation updates as a requirement.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Development workflow scripts automatically detect when user documentation needs updating
2. Task completion checklist includes documentation update verification as mandatory step
3. VS Code tasks provide clear guidance on which documentation files need updating
4. Documentation update process integrates with existing AI analysis to suggest content changes
5. Framework prevents marking tasks "complete" until documentation is verified as current

### Integration Verification

**IV1**: Documentation workflow integrates seamlessly with existing EmberCare adapter without changing core analysis
**IV2**: Documentation requirements do not impact existing AI analysis performance or accuracy
**IV3**: Documentation verification step integrates with VS Code task progress indicators

### BMAD-First Implementation Requirement

**BMAD1**: Implement this feature in BMAD-METHOD first before adding to RAPID-AI
**BMAD2**: Use BMAD implementation to validate the documentation workflow approach
**BMAD3**: Extract proven patterns from BMAD implementation for RAPID-AI integration

### BMAD-First Implementation Strategy
**Critical Requirement**: This feature must be implemented in BMAD-METHOD first to validate the approach before adding to RAPID-AI. BMAD is currently needed to get RAPID-AI to a working state, so fixing BMAD documentation workflow will speed development and ensure systematic, deliberate progress.

**BMAD Implementation Benefits**:
- Validates documentation workflow approach with real usage
- Provides proven patterns for RAPID-AI integration
- Accelerates RAPID-AI development by improving BMAD efficiency
- Ensures documentation stays current during RAPID-AI development

[Source: User requirement for BMAD-first implementation]

### BMAD-METHOD Implementation Context (PRIMARY FOCUS)

**BMAD Core Files for Documentation Workflow**:
- `.bmad-core/tasks/` - Add new documentation workflow tasks
- `.bmad-core/checklists/` - Create documentation verification checklists
- `.bmad-core/agents/` - Enhance dev agent with documentation workflow capabilities
- `.bmad-core/templates/` - Add documentation update templates
- `AGENTS.md` - Update agent definitions to include documentation responsibilities

**BMAD Task Integration**: Documentation workflow must integrate with BMAD's existing agent-driven task system. The dev agent must have documentation verification as part of its completion workflow.

[Source: AGENTS.md and .bmad-core/ directory structure from BMAD-METHOD]

### BMAD Documentation Workflow Implementation Requirements

**BMAD Task Definitions**: Create new tasks in `.bmad-core/tasks/` for:
- `validate-documentation-currency.md` - Check if documentation is current with code changes
- `update-documentation.md` - Guide for updating specific documentation sections
- `documentation-completion-gate.md` - Prevent task completion without documentation verification

**BMAD Agent Enhancement**: Modify dev agent in `.bmad-core/agents/dev.md` to include documentation verification in the `develop-story` command workflow. Documentation verification must be mandatory before marking tasks complete.

**BMAD Checklist Integration**: Create documentation verification checklist in `.bmad-core/checklists/documentation-currency-checklist.md` to systematically verify documentation is current.

[Source: BMAD-METHOD agent and task structure patterns from extracted workflows]

### BMAD File Change Detection Logic

**BMAD Implementation Strategy**: Use BMAD's existing agent orchestration to detect when documentation updates are needed:
- File change analysis through dev agent's existing file tracking
- Integration with BMAD's existing completion workflow
- Leverage BMAD's agent communication patterns for documentation guidance

**BMAD Documentation Mapping**: Map BMAD project changes to documentation requirements:
- Agent definition changes → `AGENTS.md` updates
- Task definition changes → Task documentation updates  
- Workflow changes → Process documentation updates
- Core methodology changes → Framework documentation updates

[Source: BMAD-METHOD current file structure and agent workflow patterns]

### RAPID-AI Implementation (SECONDARY - After BMAD Validation)

**Three-Layer Architecture Integration**: After BMAD validation, adapt proven patterns to RAPID-AI's Core → Adapters → Templates structure, ensuring EmberCare compatibility.

**VS Code Task Integration**: Apply BMAD-proven documentation workflow patterns to RAPID-AI's VS Code task system.

**Shell Script Adaptation**: Convert BMAD documentation workflow patterns to POSIX-compatible shell scripts for RAPID-AI portability.

### BMAD AI Integration for Documentation

**BMAD Documentation Analysis**: Leverage BMAD's existing agent interaction patterns to analyze documentation currency:
- Use BMAD's agent communication system to coordinate documentation checks
- Integrate with BMAD's existing AI tool usage patterns
- Build on BMAD's systematic workflow approach for documentation validation

**BMAD AI Prompts**: Create BMAD-specific prompts for:
- Analyzing whether `AGENTS.md` reflects current agent definitions
- Checking if task documentation matches actual task implementations
- Validating workflow documentation against actual usage patterns
- Identifying gaps in BMAD framework documentation

**BMAD Performance Requirements**: Documentation analysis must integrate with BMAD's existing workflow timing without impacting agent orchestration performance.

### RAPID-AI Technical Details (Post-BMAD Implementation)

**Documentation Detection Logic**: After BMAD validation, implement detection logic for RAPID-AI specific files:
- File change analysis for user-facing features
- Configuration change detection
- Documentation mapping for three-layer architecture

**RAPID-AI AI Integration**: Adapt BMAD-proven documentation AI analysis to RAPID-AI's GitHub Copilot CLI integration patterns.

### BMAD Testing Requirements (PRIMARY)

**BMAD-METHOD Testing Standards**:
- Test documentation workflow with BMAD's agent system in real project usage
- Verify documentation verification integrates with BMAD's task completion flow
- Validate documentation detection works with BMAD's file change tracking
- Test BMAD agent coordination for documentation guidance
- Ensure documentation workflow enhances BMAD's systematic approach

**BMAD Testing Framework**: Test with actual BMAD projects and agent workflows to validate:
- Agent definitions in `.bmad-core/agents/` properly reflect documentation responsibilities
- Task definitions in `.bmad-core/tasks/` include documentation verification steps
- BMAD's existing workflow orchestration handles documentation requirements

**BMAD Validation Criteria**: Documentation workflow must improve BMAD's efficiency and ensure systematic, deliberate progress without breaking existing agent coordination.

[Source: BMAD-METHOD testing approach and user requirement for BMAD-first validation]

### RAPID-AI Testing (SECONDARY - Post-BMAD)

**RAPID-AI Testing Standards**: After BMAD validation, test adapted patterns with:
- EmberCare adapter compatibility (must remain unchanged)
- VS Code task integration with documentation guidance  
- AI analysis performance impact verification

[Source: RAPID-AI architecture testing approach - applied after BMAD implementation]

### Critical Constraints

**BMAD-First Implementation**: Must implement and validate in BMAD-METHOD before any RAPID-AI work. This is a hard requirement to accelerate overall development by improving the tool currently being used to build RAPID-AI.

**BMAD Agent System Integration**: Documentation workflow must integrate with BMAD's existing agent orchestration system without disrupting current agent coordination patterns.

**BMAD Methodology Preservation**: Documentation workflow must enhance BMAD's systematic approach while maintaining existing agent roles and task definitions structure.

**RAPID-AI Secondary Phase**: EmberCare compatibility and VS Code task integration are secondary concerns, addressed only after BMAD implementation is proven effective.
