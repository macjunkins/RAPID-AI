# Story 1.2: Extract Systematic SDLC Workflows from BMAD Source Material

## Status: Done

## Story

**As a** developer seeking systematic development processes,
**I want** proven SDLC workflows extracted from BMAD source material without methodology branding,
**so that** I can use practical, systematic approaches to AI-powered development.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Useful systematic workflow patterns identified and extracted from `.bmad-core/` directory
2. BMAD-specific branding and methodology terminology removed from extracted patterns
3. Extracted workflows integrated into RAPID-AI's direct AI-in-SDLC approach
4. Clear documentation created for systematic processes using practical, actionable language
5. Extracted workflows enhance existing AI analysis without replacing proven patterns

### Integration Verification

**IV1**: EmberCare Flutter adapter patterns remain unmodified and fully functional
**IV2**: Extracted workflows integrate with existing configuration system without breaking existing settings
**IV3**: Systematic processes enhance rather than replace existing AI integration patterns

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [x] Create `core/workflows/` directory for systematic process scripts
  - [x] Adapt extracted workflows to work with existing VS Code task interface

  - [x] Maintain compatibility with existing shell script architecture

- [x] Task 4: Document Systematic Process Options (AC: 4, 5)
  - [x] Create documentation for available systematic workflow options
  - [x] Document configuration options for enabling systematic processes
  - [x] Provide examples of systematic workflows in practice
  - [x] Ensure documentation uses practical, actionable language

- [x] Task 5: Verify Integration and Compatibility (AC: IV1, IV2, IV3)
  - [x] Test EmberCare Flutter adapter continues working unchanged
  - [x] Verify existing `.ai-workflow.yaml` configurations remain functional
  - [x] Ensure systematic processes enhance rather than replace existing AI patterns
  - [x] Test VS Code task reliability with new systematic workflow options

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 - VS Code task reliability and environment detection are critical. All new systematic workflows must integrate through the VS Code task interface without breaking existing patterns.

[Source: Story 1.1 completion notes]

### Architecture Context
RAPID-AI follows a three-layer architecture with VS Code tasks as the primary interface, shell scripts for core logic, and adapters for project-specific implementations. Systematic workflows must integrate at the core layer without disrupting the proven EmberCare adapter patterns.

### BMAD Source Material Analysis
The `.bmad-core/` directory contains systematic SDLC workflow components that can be extracted:
- **agents/**: Agent patterns for systematic roles (extract useful patterns, remove methodology)
- **tasks/**: Proven task definitions for SDLC activities
- **templates/**: Document templates for systematic documentation
- **checklists/**: Quality and process checklists
- **workflows/**: Workflow orchestration patterns

### Key Technical Requirements

**Shell Script Integration**: All extracted workflows must be implemented as POSIX-compatible shell scripts to maintain portability and integrate with existing `core/workflows/common-functions.sh` patterns.

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#shell-script-standards]

**VS Code Task Interface**: Systematic workflows must be accessible through VS Code tasks, following the same pattern as existing `ai-discovery.sh` and `ai-implementation-plan.sh` scripts.

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md - VS Code Tasks as Primary Interface]

**Configuration Integration**: Systematic workflows must integrate through the existing `.ai-workflow.yaml` configuration system without breaking existing EmberCare configurations.

[Source: architecture/data-models-and-apis.md#configuration-data-model]

### File Locations
Based on project structure, extracted workflows should be organized as:
- `core/workflows/systematic/` - New directory for systematic workflow scripts
- `templates/vscode/tasks.json` - Enhanced with systematic workflow task definitions
- `adapters/*/` - Existing adapters remain unchanged
- `docs/` - Documentation for systematic workflow options

[Source: architecture/source-tree-and-module-organization.md#project-structure-actual]

### Critical Constraints

**EmberCare Compatibility**: The proven EmberCare Flutter adapter must remain 100% functional without modification. This is a non-negotiable requirement.

**No Methodology Overhead**: Extract practical workflow components only. Remove all BMAD-specific methodology terminology and framework concepts.

**Direct AI Integration**: Systematic workflows must enhance existing AI analysis patterns, not replace them. The focus remains on direct AI-in-SDLC integration.

### Testing

**Testing Standards**
- Manual testing with EmberCare Flutter adapter to ensure no regression
- VS Code task testing to verify systematic workflows integrate properly
- Configuration testing to ensure existing `.ai-workflow.yaml` files continue working
- Shell script testing to ensure POSIX compatibility maintained

**Testing Framework**
No formal testing framework required - focus on integration testing with existing proven patterns and manual verification of EmberCare compatibility.
