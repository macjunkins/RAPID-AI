            ## RAPID-AI Dual-Mode Framework

            ### Conversational Mode (Discovery & Planning)
            Use when: Exploring, brainstorming, creating specs
            Activation: `/rapid` in Claude CLI
            Commands:
              - `/rapid:create-doc {template}` - Create PRD, Epic, Story
              - `/rapid:task brownfield-create-epic` - Brownfield workflows
              - `/rapid:checklist story-dod` - Quality gates

            ### Execution Mode (Deterministic Implementation)
            Use when: Generating code from YAML specs
            Activation: VS Code tasks
            Tasks:
              - "RAPID: Generate Story from Epic" - YAML story generation
              - "RAPID: Validate YAML" - Schema validation

            # RAPID-AI 2.0

            Unified AI development framework combining:
            - **Conversational workflows** for discovery & planning
            - **YAML-first execution** for deterministic code generation

            ## Quick Start

            ### Drop into Any Project
            ```bash
            cp -r RAPID-AI/dist/.vscode /path/to/your-project/
            ```

            ### Use Conversational Mode
            ```bash
            claude
            /rapid
            /rapid:create-doc prd-tmpl
            ```

            ### Use Execution Mode
            ```
            Cmd+Shift+P → "RAPID: Generate Story from Epic"
            ```

summary:
  what_we_built: |
    Complete architectural pivot from conversational BMAD agents to YAML-first
    structured execution framework. Story 1.1 (Generate Story YAML from Epic)
    implemented and ready for testing. Framework now self-contained in .vscode/
    for easy distribution.

  current_status: "Story 1.1 implementation complete, testing revealed missing 'timeout' command on macOS"

  next_session_start: "Fix timeout command issue, test story generation, distribute to EmberCare"

# ============================================================================
# KEY DECISIONS
# ============================================================================

decisions:
  architectural_pivot:
    from: "Conversational BMAD agents + Markdown outputs + CoPilot only"
    to: "YAML-first structured data + Claude CLI + Execution-focused"
    rationale: |
      Conversation doesn't scale for execution. YAML provides:
      - 50-70% token savings (4.3K → 1.5-2K tokens per story)
      - Deterministic parsing (no natural language ambiguity)
      - Schema validation ensures correctness
      - Queryable and automatable

  conversation_vs_execution:
    conversation_mode:
      use_for: "Ideation, exploration, brainstorming, architectural decisions"
      format: "Natural conversation with Claude"
      token_cost: "High but worth it - this is creative work"
    execution_mode:
      use_for: "Code generation from structured specifications"
      format: "YAML input → Code output"
      token_cost: "Minimal - deterministic, no interpretation needed"

  yaml_only:
    decision: "YAML-first, no markdown"
    reasoning: "AI consumption optimized, can add markdown later if needed"
    benefits:
      - "Deterministic parsing"
      - "Schema validation"
      - "50-70% token savings"
      - "Queryable with yq"

  documentation_workflow:
    decision: "Remove per-task documentation verification"
    keep: "Epic-level documentation tracking only"
    reasoning: "Reduce ceremony, solo developer doesn't need automated enforcement"

  vscode_structure:
    decision: "All RAPID-AI code lives in .vscode/"
    structure: |
      .vscode/
      ├── tasks.json
      ├── core/
      │   ├── scripts/
      │   ├── workflows/
      │   └── config/
      └── README.md
    benefits:
      - "Single directory copy for distribution"
      - "No root directory pollution"
      - "Works with existing docs/ structure"
      - "Self-contained and portable"

  dogfooding:
    approach: "RAPID-AI uses .vscode/ for self-development"
    distribution: "Copy .vscode/ to any project (e.g., EmberCare)"
    testing: "Test in RAPID-AI first, then distribute"
