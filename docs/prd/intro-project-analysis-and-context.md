# Intro Project Analysis and Context

## Analysis Source

**Document-project output available at:** `docs/brownfield-architecture.md`

Based on comprehensive brownfield architecture analysis completed October 22, 2025, which provides detailed understanding of current system state, technical debt, and integration points.

## Current Project State

**Extracted from brownfield architecture analysis:**

RAPID-AI is a **systematic AI-powered Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) framework** extracted from the production EmberCare healthcare app. It provides structured, repeatable processes for AI-assisted story analysis and implementation planning, with the primary goal of reliable VS Code task integration.

**Current Architecture**: Framework is primarily a collection of shell scripts with VS Code task integration, not a CLI application. The Node.js CLI wrapper is secondary - an optional interaction method for those who prefer command-line usage.

## Available Documentation Analysis

**Document-project analysis available** - using existing technical documentation:

✅ **Key Documents Created by Document-Project:**
- ✅ Tech Stack Documentation (comprehensive with version analysis)
- ✅ Source Tree/Architecture (three-layer: Core → Adapters → Templates)
- ✅ Coding Standards (shell script portability, POSIX compatibility)
- ✅ API Documentation (VS Code tasks, shell scripts, configuration)
- ✅ External API Documentation (GitHub Copilot CLI integration)
- ✅ Technical Debt Documentation (critical issues identified)
- ✅ Integration Points (VS Code, EmberCare compatibility, BMAD source material)

## Enhancement Scope Definition

### Enhancement Type
- ✅ **Major Feature Modification** (systematic SDLC process enhancement)
- ✅ **Integration with New Systems** (extracting BMAD systematic workflows)
- ✅ **Bug Fix and Stability Improvements** (VS Code task reliability)

### Enhancement Description

Transform RAPID-AI from basic script collection to comprehensive systematic AI-powered SDLC process by: (1) making VS Code tasks reliably functional as primary interface, (2) extracting proven systematic development workflows from BMAD source material (removing branding/methodology overhead), and (3) building deliberate AI-in-SDLC processes for consistent story analysis and implementation planning.

### Impact Assessment
- ✅ **Significant Impact** (substantial existing code changes required)
- Focus on systematic enhancement while preserving EmberCare compatibility

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Reliable VS Code task integration as primary user interface for AI-powered story analysis
- Systematic SDLC processes extracted from BMAD source material without methodology branding
- Consistent, repeatable AI-powered development workflows for story analysis and implementation
- Maintain 100% compatibility with existing EmberCare production usage patterns
- Build foundation for multi-AI support while improving current GitHub Copilot integration

### Background Context

The RAPID-AI framework was successfully extracted from EmberCare's production environment where it delivers 85-90% time reduction in story analysis (2-4 hours → 15-30 minutes). However, the current system is project scaffolding that needs systematic enhancement to become a reliable, general-purpose AI-powered SDLC framework.

The primary challenge is that VS Code tasks (the intended primary interface) have reliability issues due to path dependencies and error handling. Additionally, valuable systematic SDLC patterns exist in the BMAD source material (`.bmad-core/`) but are wrapped in methodology-specific branding that obscures practical workflow value.
