# Epic 1: Systematic AI-Powered SDLC Process Enhancement

**Epic Goal**: Transform RAPID-AI from basic script collection to reliable, systematic AI-powered SDLC framework with VS Code tasks as primary interface and extracted BMAD systematic workflows integrated without methodology overhead.

**Integration Requirements**: Must maintain 100% EmberCare compatibility while enhancing VS Code task reliability and integrating systematic SDLC processes extracted from BMAD source material.

## Story 1.1: Fix VS Code Task Reliability and Path Dependencies

As a developer using RAPID-AI,
I want VS Code tasks to execute reliably across different project structures,
so that I can use AI-powered story analysis without path dependency failures.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. VS Code tasks execute successfully regardless of project directory structure
2. Error messages provide clear guidance when prerequisites are missing
3. Progress indicators work correctly in VS Code environment
4. Task execution completes within 120-second timeout with appropriate feedback
5. Tasks handle missing AI tools gracefully with actionable error messages

### Integration Verification

**IV1**: EmberCare Flutter adapter continues to work with existing directory structure and configuration
**IV2**: All existing shell script interfaces maintain current argument patterns and behavior
**IV3**: Task execution time remains within existing performance characteristics (15-30 minutes for story analysis)

## Story 1.2: Extract Systematic SDLC Workflows from BMAD Source Material

As a developer seeking systematic development processes,
I want proven SDLC workflows extracted from BMAD source material without methodology branding,
so that I can use practical, systematic approaches to AI-powered development.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Useful systematic workflow patterns identified and extracted from `.bmad-core/` directory
2. BMAD-specific branding and methodology terminology removed from extracted patterns
3. Extracted workflows integrated into RAPID-AI's direct AI-in-SDLC approach
4. Clear documentation created for systematic processes using practical, actionable language
5. Extracted workflows enhance existing AI analysis without replacing proven patterns

### Integration Verification

**IV1**: EmberCare Flutter adapter patterns remain unmodified and fully functional
**IV2**: Extracted workflows integrate with existing configuration system without breaking existing settings
**IV3**: Systematic processes enhance rather than replace existing AI integration patterns

## Story 1.3: Implement Documentation-as-You-Go Workflow Integration

As a developer completing development tasks using RAPID-AI,
I want documentation to be automatically updated as part of the development workflow,
so that user documentation stays current and task completion includes documentation updates as a requirement.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Development workflow scripts automatically detect when user documentation needs updating
2. Task completion checklist includes documentation update verification as mandatory step
3. VS Code tasks provide clear guidance on which documentation files need updating
4. Documentation update process integrates with existing AI analysis to suggest content changes
5. Framework prevents marking tasks "complete" until documentation is verified as current

### Integration Verification

**IV1**: Documentation workflow integrates seamlessly with existing EmberCare adapter without changing core analysis
**IV2**: Documentation requirements do not impact existing AI analysis performance or accuracy
**IV3**: Documentation verification step integrates with VS Code task progress indicators

## Story 1.4: Enhance AI Integration Reliability and Multi-AI Foundation

As a developer using AI-powered analysis,
I want reliable AI integration with foundation for multiple AI tools,
so that I have consistent, dependable AI analysis regardless of AI tool availability.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. GitHub Copilot integration remains reliable with improved error handling
2. AI abstraction layer enhanced to support future multi-AI implementation
3. Timeout and error handling improved for AI tool failures
4. Progress indicators provide accurate feedback during AI analysis
5. Framework gracefully handles AI tool unavailability with appropriate fallback messaging

### Integration Verification

**IV1**: Existing EmberCare AI analysis performance and accuracy maintained exactly
**IV2**: Current GitHub Copilot CLI integration continues working without modification
**IV3**: Enhanced error handling does not impact successful AI analysis execution timing

## Story 1.5: Integrate Systematic Configuration and Documentation

As a developer configuring RAPID-AI for systematic SDLC processes,
I want clear configuration options for systematic workflows,
so that I can enable systematic AI-powered development processes appropriate to my project.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Configuration system extended to support systematic SDLC process settings
2. Documentation created for systematic workflow configuration options
3. Systematic processes integrate through existing YAML configuration approach
4. Clear examples provided for different project types and systematic process levels
5. Configuration validation ensures settings are appropriate for project context

### Integration Verification

**IV1**: Existing EmberCare configuration continues working without modification
**IV2**: Configuration system extensions maintain backward compatibility with existing `.ai-workflow.yaml` files
**IV3**: New systematic configuration options do not affect existing adapter behavior when not enabled
