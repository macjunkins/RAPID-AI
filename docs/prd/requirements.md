# Requirements

## Functional

**FR1**: VS Code tasks must execute reliably across different project structures without path dependency failures

**FR2**: AI-powered story analysis must generate technically accurate implementation guidance using extracted systematic SDLC processes

**FR3**: Framework must automatically detect project type and apply appropriate adapter patterns (Flutter proven, others planned)

**FR4**: Systematic workflow templates must be extracted from BMAD source material and integrated without BMAD-specific branding or methodology terminology

**FR5**: Configuration system must drive behavior consistently across all interfaces (VS Code tasks, optional CLI, direct script usage)

**FR6**: Framework must maintain environment awareness (VS Code, terminal, Codespaces) and adapt interface behavior accordingly

**FR7**: AI integration layer must support multiple AI tools through unified abstraction (currently only GitHub Copilot implemented)

## Non Functional

**NFR1**: Enhancement must maintain existing EmberCare performance characteristics and not impact production workflow timing (15-30 minute story analysis)

**NFR2**: VS Code task execution must complete within 120-second timeout with appropriate progress indicators

**NFR3**: Framework must remain portable across macOS, Linux, and Windows development environments through POSIX-compatible shell scripts

**NFR4**: All systematic SDLC processes must be documented with clear, actionable guidance free of methodology-specific terminology

**NFR5**: Error handling must provide clear, actionable feedback when AI tools fail or paths are incorrect

## Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: All existing EmberCare Flutter adapter functionality must continue working without modification to maintain production usage

**CR2**: Shell script interfaces and argument patterns must remain backward compatible for direct script usage

**CR3**: Configuration file format (`.ai-workflow.yaml`) must support existing EmberCare configuration while extending for new systematic features  

**CR4**: VS Code task definitions must integrate with existing workspace configurations without requiring global VS Code modifications
