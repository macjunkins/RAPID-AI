# Epic YAML Files

This directory contains sharded epic specifications in YAML format.

## Purpose

Epic YAML files define feature groups and story collections. Each epic is a self-contained YAML file that provides context for AI-powered story generation.

## Naming Convention

```
epic-{n}.yaml
```

Examples:
- `epic-1.yaml` - Epic 1: Structured YAML Workflow Foundation
- `epic-2.yaml` - Epic 2: Claude CLI Integration
- `epic-3.yaml` - Epic 3: VS Code Task Enhancement

## Epic YAML Structure

```yaml
epic:
  id: 1
  title: "Epic Title"
  priority: "critical"          # critical|high|medium|low
  status: "in_progress"         # planned|in_progress|completed

  description: |
    Multi-line description of epic scope and purpose

  goals:
    - "Goal 1"
    - "Goal 2"

  success_criteria:
    - "Success metric 1"
    - "Success metric 2"

  documentation:
    updated: "2025-10-23"
    status: "current"
    notes: |
      Epic-level documentation tracking.
      Stories don't require individual doc verification.

  stories:
    - id: 1
      title: "Story 1 Title"
      priority: "critical"
      status: "in_progress"
      estimated_effort: "3-4 hours"
      description: |
        Brief story description
      acceptance_criteria:
        - "Criteria 1"
        - "Criteria 2"

  technical_requirements:
    prerequisites:
      - tool: "Tool name"
        command: "verification command"
        required: true
        purpose: "Why needed"

  risk_assessment:
    - risk: "Risk description"
      impact: "High|Medium|Low"
      mitigation: "How to mitigate"
```

## Relationship to Stories

Epic YAML files provide **context** for story generation:

1. Epic defines the overall feature area
2. Each epic contains brief story summaries
3. Full story details live in `docs/stories/{epic}-{story}-story.yaml`
4. Story generation reads epic context to ensure relevance

## Querying Epics

Use `yq` to query epic files:

### List all epics
```bash
yq eval '.epic.title' docs/prd/epic-*.yaml
```

### Find in-progress epics
```bash
yq eval 'select(.epic.status == "in_progress") | .epic.title' docs/prd/epic-*.yaml
```

### Show all stories in Epic 1
```bash
yq eval '.epic.stories[].title' docs/prd/epic-1.yaml
```

### List critical priority stories across all epics
```bash
yq eval '.epic.stories[] | select(.priority == "critical") | .title' docs/prd/epic-*.yaml
```

## Epic-Level Documentation Tracking

Unlike individual stories, **epics have documentation requirements**:

```yaml
documentation:
  updated: "2025-10-23"
  status: "current"
  notes: |
    Documentation required at epic completion:
    - README.md updates
    - CLAUDE.md philosophy updates
    - Example files in docs/examples/
```

This ensures major features update user-facing documentation without story-level ceremony.

## Current Epics

### Epic 1: Structured YAML Workflow Foundation
**Priority:** Critical
**Status:** In Progress

Establish YAML-first architecture for deterministic AI execution.

**Key Stories:**
1. Generate Story YAML from Epic Context âœ… (IMMEDIATE VALUE)
2. Define Story YAML Schema and Validation
3. Create Epic YAML Schema and Directory Structure
4. Create Working VS Code Task Suite
5. Implement Token Usage Tracking

### Epic 2: Claude CLI Integration (Planned)
**Priority:** Critical
**Status:** Planned

Add Claude CLI support for superior reasoning alongside CoPilot.

### Epic 3: VS Code Task Enhancement (Planned)
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Planned

Update VS Code tasks for seamless YAML workflows.

### Epic 4: Strip BMAD Overhead (Planned)
**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** Planned

Remove BMAD branding and extract useful patterns.

## Creating New Epics

### Manual Creation
Copy an existing epic as template:

```bash
cp docs/prd/epic-1.yaml docs/prd/epic-2.yaml
# Edit epic-2.yaml with new content
```

### AI-Generated (Future)
Story 2.x will add epic generation from product context:

```bash
./core/scripts/generate-epic-yaml.sh 2 "Epic Title"
```

## Validation

Validate epic YAML:

```bash
# Basic YAML syntax check
yq eval . docs/prd/epic-1.yaml

# Schema validation (coming in Epic 1, Story 3)
./scripts/validate-yaml.sh docs/prd/epic-1.yaml
```

## Integration with PRD

Epic files are referenced from main PRD:

```yaml
# docs/prd.yaml
product:
  name: "RAPID-AI 2.0"

  epics_location: "docs/prd/"
  epic_count: 4

  epics_summary:
    - id: 1
      title: "Structured YAML Workflow Foundation"
      status: "in_progress"
```

## Philosophy

**Epics = Feature Groups**
Epics group related stories into coherent feature areas.

**Context for AI**
Epic YAML provides context so AI generates relevant, accurate story specifications.

**Sharded Structure**
Each epic in separate file enables:
- Focused changes (better git diffs)
- Parallel epic development
- Easier querying and automation

## Next Steps

After creating an epic:

1. **Generate Stories** - Use "RAPID: Generate Story from Epic" task
2. **Implement Stories** - Work through stories sequentially
3. **Update Status** - Mark stories complete as finished
4. **Epic Documentation** - Update docs when epic complete
