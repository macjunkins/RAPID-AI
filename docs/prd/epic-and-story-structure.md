# Epic and Story Structure

## Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single comprehensive epic with sequential story implementation

**Rationale**: Based on brownfield architecture analysis, this enhancement involves systematic improvement of existing functionality rather than addition of unrelated features. Single epic ensures coordinated enhancement while maintaining system integrity throughout development process.
