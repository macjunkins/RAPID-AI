# Introduction

This document captures the **CURRENT STATE** of the RAPID-AI framework codebase, including working patterns, proven implementations, and real-world constraints. It serves as a baseline reference for AI agents working on enhancements and building a **systematic AI-powered Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process**.

## Document Scope

**Focused on the complete current system** with special attention to areas relevant to:
- **Primary Goal**: Making VS Code tasks work reliably for AI-powered story analysis
- **Secondary Goal**: Extracting useful workflows/templates from BMAD source material (without branding)
- **Core Purpose**: Building a deliberate, systematic AI-in-SDLC process
