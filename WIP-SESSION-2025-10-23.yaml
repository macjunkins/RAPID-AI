session:
  date: "2025-10-23"
  duration: "~3 hours"
  status: "paused - bug found during testing"
  topic: "RAPID-AI 2.0 - Major Course Correction to YAML-First Structured Execution"

summary:
  what_we_built: |
    Complete architectural pivot from conversational BMAD agents to YAML-first
    structured execution framework. Story 1.1 (Generate Story YAML from Epic)
    implemented and ready for testing. Framework now self-contained in .vscode/
    for easy distribution.

  current_status: "Story 1.1 implementation complete, testing revealed missing 'timeout' command on macOS"

  next_session_start: "Fix timeout command issue, test story generation, distribute to EmberCare"

# Key Decisions Made

decisions:
  architectural_pivot:
    from: "Conversational BMAD agents + Markdown outputs + CoPilot only"
    to: "YAML-first structured data + Claude CLI + Execution-focused"
    rationale: |
      Conversation doesn't scale for execution. YAML provides:
      - 50-70% token savings (4.3K → 1.5-2K tokens per story)
      - Deterministic parsing (no natural language ambiguity)
      - Schema validation ensures correctness
      - Queryable and automatable

  conversation_vs_execution:
    conversation_mode:
      use_for: "Ideation, exploration, brainstorming, architectural decisions"
      format: "Natural conversation with Claude"
      token_cost: "High but worth it - this is creative work"
    execution_mode:
      use_for: "Code generation from structured specifications"
      format: "YAML input → Code output"
      token_cost: "Minimal - deterministic, no interpretation needed"

  yaml_only:
    decision: "YAML-first, no markdown"
    reasoning: "AI consumption optimized, can add markdown later if needed"
    benefits:
      - "Deterministic parsing"
      - "Schema validation"
      - "50-70% token savings"
      - "Queryable with yq"

  documentation_workflow:
    decision: "Remove per-task documentation verification"
    keep: "Epic-level documentation tracking only"
    reasoning: "Reduce ceremony, solo developer doesn't need automated enforcement"

  vscode_structure:
    decision: "All RAPID-AI code lives in .vscode/"
    structure: |
      .vscode/
      ├── tasks.json
      ├── core/
      │   ├── scripts/
      │   ├── workflows/
      │   └── config/
      └── README.md
    benefits:
      - "Single directory copy for distribution"
      - "No root directory pollution"
      - "Works with existing docs/ structure"
      - "Self-contained and portable"

  dogfooding:
    approach: "RAPID-AI uses .vscode/ for self-development"
    distribution: "Copy .vscode/ to any project (e.g., EmberCare)"
    testing: "Test in RAPID-AI first, then distribute"

# Current Bug

bug:
  issue: "timeout command not found on macOS"
  location: ".vscode/core/scripts/generate-story-yaml.sh:214"
  error_message: "/Users/johnjunkins/GitHub/RAPID-AI/.vscode/core/scripts/generate-story-yaml.sh: line 214: timeout: command not found"

  context: |
    Script uses: timeout 60s claude -p "$PROMPT"
    macOS doesn't have 'timeout' command by default (it's a GNU coreutils command)

  fix_options:
    option_1:
      approach: "Install GNU coreutils via Homebrew"
      command: "brew install coreutils"
      result: "timeout command available as 'gtimeout'"
      notes: "Requires Homebrew, adds dependency"

    option_2:
      approach: "Use Bash built-in with background process"
      implementation: |
        claude -p "$PROMPT" > "$TEMP_OUTPUT" 2>&1 &
        CLAUDE_PID=$!
        sleep 60
        if kill -0 $CLAUDE_PID 2>/dev/null; then
          kill $CLAUDE_PID
          echo "Timeout"
        fi
        wait $CLAUDE_PID
      notes: "No dependencies, pure Bash"

    option_3:
      approach: "Remove timeout entirely for MVP"
      rationale: "Claude CLI is fast (10-30 seconds), timeout might be premature optimization"
      notes: "Simplest fix, can add timeout later if needed"

  recommendation: "Option 2 - Use Bash built-in approach (portable, no dependencies)"

# Technical Facts Established

facts:

# Open Questions

questions:
  timeout_implementation:
    question: "Which timeout approach to use?"
    options:
      - "Bash built-in (portable)"
      - "Install GNU coreutils (adds dependency)"
      - "Remove timeout for MVP (simplest)"
    recommendation: "Bash built-in for portability"

  yq_installation:
    question: "Should yq be required or optional?"
    current: "Optional - validation skipped if missing"
    recommendation: "Keep optional, show helpful message"

  token_tracking:
    question: "When to implement token usage tracking (Story 1.5)?"
    timing: "After Stories 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 complete"
    purpose: "Measure actual token savings vs markdown"

  markdown_generation:
    question: "Should we auto-generate markdown from YAML for GitHub readability?"
    decision: "Not for MVP - YAML-only is sufficient"
    revisit: "After YAML workflows proven with EmberCare"

# Context for Next Session
