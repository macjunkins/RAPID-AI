# RAPID-AI BMAD Workflow Implementation Plan

**Date Created**: October 22, 2025  
**Project**: RAPID-AI Framework Enhancement  
**Current Status**: Brainstorming Complete â†’ Starting BMAD Workflow  
**Goal**: Complete systematic transformation from basic scripts to comprehensive AI workflow system

---

## Your Unique Situation Assessment

**What You Have:**
- âœ… Excellent brainstorming session with Six Thinking Hats analysis
- âœ… Working foundation scripts (core/scripts/, adapters/flutter/)
- âœ… Basic VS Code task integration
- âœ… Clear vision and philosophy established
- âœ… BMAD framework available for integration

**What You Need:**
- ðŸ“‹ Proper project documentation (current state)
- ðŸ“‹ Brownfield PRD with requirements
- ðŸ“‹ Technical architecture document
- ðŸ“‹ Implementation plan with epics/stories
- ðŸ“‹ Systematic execution workflow

**Your Challenge:** You're doing a major brownfield enhancement on your own project, so you need to wear multiple hats but in the right sequence.

## Complete BMAD Workflow Plan

### Phase 1: Document Current State (Foundation)
**Duration:** 1-2 days  
**Purpose:** Create baseline documentation of existing RAPID-AI system

#### Step 1.1: Project Documentation Analysis
**Agent:** BMad Master  
**Command:** `*document-project`  
**Output:** `docs/brownfield-architecture.md`
**Purpose:** Analyze current RAPID-AI codebase and create comprehensive baseline

**What This Will Do:**
- Analyze existing scripts, adapters, CLI structure
- Document current tech stack and patterns
- Identify technical debt and constraints
- Map integration points and dependencies
- Create "reality check" documentation for enhancement planning

**Why First:** You can't plan a brownfield enhancement without understanding what you're enhancing!

#### Step 1.2: Validate Documentation
**Review:** Ensure the document-project output accurately reflects your system
**Adjust:** Make any corrections needed for accuracy

### Phase 2: Requirements & Strategy (Planning)
**Duration:** 2-3 days  
**Purpose:** Transform brainstorming into formal requirements and strategy

#### Step 2.1: Create Brownfield PRD
**Agent:** BMad Master (or PM Agent if you prefer formal PM role)  
**Command:** `*create-doc brownfield-prd-tmpl.yaml`  
**Input:** Your brainstorming session + brownfield architecture document  
**Output:** `docs/prd.md`

**What This Will Cover:**
- Formal requirements based on brainstorming insights
- Technical constraints from current system analysis
- Integration requirements for BMAD components
- Epic structure for systematic implementation
- Risk assessment and compatibility requirements

#### Step 2.2: Create Technical Architecture
**Agent:** Architect Agent  
**Command:** `*agent architect` then `*create-brownfield-architecture`  
**Input:** PRD requirements + current system analysis  
**Output:** `docs/architecture.md` or sharded `docs/architecture/`

**What This Will Design:**
- How BMAD integration will work technically
- VS Code extension architecture (future phase)
- Dashboard system design
- Multi-AI model integration approach
- File organization and minimal footprint strategy

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning (Breakdown)
**Duration:** 1-2 days  
**Purpose:** Break requirements into executable stories

#### Step 3.1: Epic and Story Creation
**Agent:** Scrum Master or Product Owner  
**Command:** `*agent sm` then `*draft` (for each epic)  
**Input:** PRD epics + technical architecture  
**Output:** `docs/stories/` with detailed implementation stories

**Expected Epics (from your brainstorming):**
1. **Epic 1: BMAD Integration Foundation** - Extract and integrate valuable BMAD components
2. **Epic 2: Dashboard System** - Create markdown-based project dashboard
3. **Epic 3: Multi-AI Model Support** - Implement model switching and management
4. **Epic 4: VS Code Task Enhancement** - Perfect the scripts + tasks workflow
5. **Epic 5: Zero-Footprint Installation** - Universal VS Code installation system

#### Step 3.2: Story Validation and Prioritization
**Agent:** Product Owner  
**Command:** `*agent po` then `*validate-story-draft` for each story  
**Purpose:** Ensure stories are implementation-ready with proper acceptance criteria

### Phase 4: Implementation Execution (Development)
**Duration:** Ongoing (weeks/months)  
**Purpose:** Systematic implementation following foundation-first strategy

#### Step 4.1: Foundation Epic First (Epic 1)
**Agent:** Full Stack Developer  
**Command:** `*agent dev` then `*develop-story` for each story in Epic 1  
**Priority:** Complete BMAD integration and basic workflow before advanced features

#### Step 4.2: Incremental Epic Development
**Strategy:** Complete one epic fully before starting the next
**Quality Gates:** Each story gets QA review before moving forward
**Progress Tracking:** Dashboard document updated as stories complete

#### Step 4.3: QA and Review Process
**Agent:** Test Architect & Quality Advisor  
**Command:** `*agent qa` then `*review` for each completed story  
**Purpose:** Ensure quality and integration integrity throughout

### Phase 5: Community Validation (Feedback)
**Duration:** 1-2 weeks  
**Purpose:** Real-world testing and community feedback

#### Step 5.1: Deploy to Personal Projects
- Test RAPID-AI on your commercial projects
- Validate the workflow improvements in real scenarios
- Document any issues or missing features

#### Step 5.2: Community Testing
- Share with fellow developers for feedback
- Gather usage data and improvement suggestions
- Refine based on actual solo developer usage patterns

## Critical Decision Points

### Decision Point 1: VS Code Global Tasks Research
**When:** During Phase 2 (Architecture planning)  
**Question:** Can VS Code tasks follow across projects globally?  
**Impact:** Determines whether to focus on tasks enhancement or plan for extension development  
**Fallback:** VS Code extension development path if global tasks don't work

### Decision Point 2: BMAD Component Selection
**When:** During Phase 2 (PRD creation)  
**Question:** Which specific BMAD components to extract and integrate?  
**Impact:** Determines scope and complexity of Epic 1  
**Strategy:** Start minimal, expand based on testing feedback

### Decision Point 3: Dashboard Implementation Approach
**When:** During Phase 3 (Story creation)  
**Question:** Markdown file vs. VS Code webview vs. future extension UI?  
**Strategy:** Start with markdown (foundation first), evolve toward extension

### Step 2: Review and Validate Documentation
- Read the generated brownfield architecture document
- Ensure it accurately captures your current system
- Note any corrections or additions needed

### Step 3: Create Brownfield PRD
```bash
# Continue with BMad Master or switch to PM agent
*create-doc brownfield-prd-tmpl.yaml
```
**Input:** Use your brainstorming session + the brownfield architecture document

### Step 4: Technical Architecture Planning
```bash
# Switch to Architect agent
*agent architect
*create-brownfield-architecture
```

## Why This Sequence Matters

1. **Foundation First:** You can't plan enhancements without understanding current reality
2. **Requirements Before Architecture:** PRD drives technical decisions, not vice versa
3. **Architecture Before Stories:** Technical design informs implementation breakdown
4. **Stories Before Development:** Systematic implementation prevents scope creep
5. **Epic Completion:** Finish one epic completely before starting the next

This approach aligns with your "Black Hat" critical thinking about foundation-first and avoiding the extension fantasy before proving the basic workflow.
