# RAPID-AI Features & Roadmap Brainstorming Session

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Topic**: Features and roadmap for RAPID-AI framework  
**Approach**: Six Thinking Hats technique  
**Goal**: Broad exploration of possibilities  

## Session Notes

### ðŸŽ© Six Thinking Hats Exploration

## ðŸŸ¦ **BLUE HAT - Process & Organization**

### Core Mission & Philosophy
- **Formal AI-assisted workflow for solo developers** - systematic, not ad hoc
- **Fire-and-forget command execution** - avoid conversational dark patterns that burn tokens
- **Get out of the "Human in the loop"** - fire off command, AI executes, human chooses next action
- **Waterfall methodology for solo work** - Agile doesn't make sense for individual developers
- **Spec-driven development with AI** - clear specifications lead to better AI outcomes
- **Anti-pattern**: Conversational tools that gaslight users into more questions for token burning/vendor lock-in

### Roadmap Structure Philosophy
- **Waterfall phases make sense for solo developers**
- **Each phase should be complete before moving to next**
- **AI + Waterfall = Spec-driven success**
- **Avoid team-based Agile concepts that don't apply to individual work**

### BMAD Integration Strategy
- **Strip out personas/gaslighting theater** - doesn't add value for solo developers
- **Keep valuable parts**: Templates, PM areas, spec document creation (PRD, UI specs)
- **Interactive conversation for spec creation** - like this brainstorming session
- **Fire-and-forget for implementation** - use existing RAPID-AI systematic approach
- **Clear division**: Conversational for planning/specs â†’ Systematic for execution

### Two-Phase Workflow Handoff
**Phase 1 Outputs**: PRD, UI specs, architecture docs
**Handoff Point**: **Dashboard document** that tracks the PRD and links back to specs
**Phase 2 Input**: Dashboard gives users solid platform to fire off systematic tasks

### Dashboard as Control Center
- **Links back to PRD/UI specs** for reference
- **Tracking mechanism** for project progress  
- **Launch pad** for systematic fire-and-forget commands
- **Single source of truth** for project state

### Dashboard Specifications
- **Next recommended steps** - always at top for quick glance
- **Project tracking** - epic/story progress and status
- **Reference hub** - links to PRD, UI specs, architecture docs
- **NO quick action center** - keep it clean and focused
- **NO template commands** - templates live in templates folder, AI follows them
- **Current format**: Markdown file
- **Future evolution**: VS Code extension â†’ Command palette tasks â†’ Copilot chat modes
- **End goal**: Entire process contained within VS Code

## ðŸŸ¢ **GREEN HAT - Creative & Innovative**

### VS Code Extension Vision: AI Orchestration Layer
- **Flyout dashboard** with interactive buttons on stories/tasks
- **Real command center** - like GitHub extension that polls for assigned issues
- **Project manager interface** - stories from PRD become actionable issues
- **Story interaction buttons** - fire off investigation/analysis/implementation
- **Comments system** - track AI outputs and decisions per story

### AI Tool Orchestration Strategy
- **Step into the middle of AI** - use as tool rather than conversation partner
- **Context-aware AI selection** - different models for different tasks
- **Anti-vendor lock-in** - push back on single-model solutions
- **Play to AI strengths** - conversation when needed, systematic when better
- **Model agnostic** - fire off different AI assistants based on task type
- **VS Code as vehicle** - leverage best free/open IDE while avoiding dark patterns

### Practical AI Model Management
- **Manual model selection** - developer chooses which model for which task
- **Flexible workflow** - complete issues â†’ work on tasks â†’ eventually create PRs
- **Issue breakdown** - complex issues split into sub-issues and tasks
- **Context window management** - start new conversations when context fills up
- **Local model support** - break down further for smaller context windows
- **Step-by-step approach** - not trying to one-shot everything
- **Developer controls timing** - work at own pace, not AI-driven pace

### Model Switching & Storage Strategy
- **Seamless model switching** - change AI models mid-workflow
- **Markdown files as shared context** - works across conversations and models
- **Cross-conversation continuity** - generated files bridge different AI chats
- **Future storage considerations** - evolution beyond simple markdown files
- **Flyout dashboard with active issue tab** - 30k foot view of current work
- **Active issue tracking** - dedicated tab for currently focused issue

### Three-Tab Dashboard Structure
**Tab 1: Grand Scheme (30K View)**
- **Active epic** showing as "in progress"
- **Next epic** in queue
- **Closed epics** (separate area/collapsed)
- **Progress bar** for overall project

**Tab 2: Current Epic**
- **Limited to open epic only** - no scrolling through 50 issues
- **Epic progress indicator**
- **Issues within current epic** with status
- **What's next** in this epic

**Tab 3: In Progress Issue**
- **Single issue focus** - current work
- **Issue progress bar**
- **GitHub-style linear view** - top to bottom single page
- **Change log at bottom** - conversations and completed work
- **Relevant AI outputs** and decisions made

### Dashboard Automation & Safeguards
**Content Automation**
- **Auto-populate tabs** as work progresses
- **Fallback options** when AI makes mistakes
- **Curated content** - not every single thing (avoid unwieldy clutter)
- **Smart filtering** - figure out details later

**Navigation Controls**
- **Model switching** - available from any tab
- **Epic/issue switching** - ONLY from dashboard (controlled transitions)
- **Git safety warnings** - prevent lost work on context switches
- **Graceful handling** - protect work in progress before switching

### Missing Key Insights to Capture

**AI Evolution Strategy**
- **AI moves fast** - models that work today may not work in 2 months
- **Manual selection strategy** - developer knows what they want when setting up, but this changes
- **No auto-routing of AI models** - user controls which model for which task always
- **Local model support critical** - smaller context windows need more breakdown

**Workflow Reality Checks**
- **Multiple issues before PRs** - may complete several issues before doing pull requests  
- **Complex work breakdown** - complicated issues split into sub-issues and tasks
- **Context window limits** - sometimes need fresh conversations mid-work
- **No one-shot everything** - step-by-step approach more reliable

**VS Code Integration Path**
- **Current: Markdown â†’ Future: Extension â†’ End Goal: Copilot Chat modes**
- **Templates in VS Code tasks eventually** - contained in task definitions
- **Command palette integration** - eventually whole process in VS Code
- **Leverage VS Code as free/open IDE** while avoiding Microsoft vendor lock-in patterns

**Git Safety Details**
- **Dirty state detection** before context switches
- **Auto-stash suggestions** when uncommitted changes exist  
- **Work-in-progress protection** to prevent data loss
- **Graceful handling required** - must protect developer work

## âš« **BLACK HAT - Critical & Cautious**

### Reality Check: Foundation First
**CRITICAL PROBLEM**: Got carried away with VS Code extension vision before proving the basic workflow
- **Current gap**: Have scripts/tools proposed but no working prototype
- **Original plan**: AI-assisted workflow using scripts run from VS Code tasks
- **Risk**: Jumping to full extension before validating core concept
- **Decision point**: Perfect scripts + tasks workflow OR abandon for direct extension prototype?

### API Pricing & Model Switching Reality
**FLEXIBLE CONSTRAINT**: System should work with OR without API pricing
- **Developer choice**: API pricing fine for those who can afford it
- **System requirement**: Must work without APIs (subscriptions, local models)
- **Personal constraint**: Author uses paid subscriptions only
- **Model switching**: Essential for usage limits regardless of payment model

### Anti-Orchestration Philosophy  
**CRITICAL CORRECTION**: AI should NOT orchestrate anything
- **Wrong thinking**: "AI orchestration layer" - AI choosing models/routing
- **Correct thinking**: Developer controls everything, AI executes when commanded
- **User remains in control**: Developer decides models, timing, workflow
- **AI role**: Do what it's good at with structure, then get out of the way

### Foundation First Strategy
**PHASE 1: Proof of Concept**
- **Goal**: Get BMAD + task creation + implementation working in VS Code as runnable tasks
- **Focus**: Scripts + VS Code tasks workflow until it's complete and valuable
- **Deliverable**: Working two-phase workflow (interactive spec â†’ systematic execution)

**FUTURE PHASES: VS Code Extension**
- **Status**: Stretch goal - keep the ideas but defer implementation
- **Rationale**: Don't build fancy UI until core workflow is proven
- **Timeline**: Much later phase after foundation is solid

### BMAD Integration Strategy (Refined)
**Extract & Rebrand Valuable Parts**
- **Keep**: Templates, workflows, tasks (PRD, UI, Architecture creation)
- **Keep**: Conversation agents for brainstorming (but drop personas)
- **Ditch**: Verbose theater, gaslighting personalities, unnecessary fluff
- **Rebrand**: Everything becomes RAPID-AI branded

**Flexible Project Setup**
- **Ideal**: Follow BMAD method start-to-finish for new projects
- **Required**: Install into existing/brownfield projects seamlessly
- **Critical use case**: Clone open source project â†’ install RAPID-AI â†’ contribute immediately
- **No assumptions**: Works with projects that already have structure/workflow

### Minimal Footprint Philosophy
**VS Code Tasks Integration**
- **Primary mechanism**: Install as VS Code tasks, not competing framework
- **Stay out of the way**: Don't interfere with existing project structure
- **Jump in and work**: Enable workflow without major project changes

**Extremely Limited Files/Folders**
- **Constraint**: Developers have multiple active projects
- **Requirement**: Minimal file creation that doesn't clutter existing repos
- **Goal**: Generate documents when needed, but keep overhead tiny
- **Integration**: Work within existing project conventions, don't impose new ones

### Zero-Footprint Task Strategy
**All Tasks in VS Code**
- **No project files**: Tasks exist in VS Code itself, work across all projects
- **Universal workflow**: Same tasks work regardless of project structure
- **Cross-project consistency**: Developer gets same workflow everywhere

**User-Defined Locations**
- **Prompt for paths**: Ask user where to put PRD, docs, analysis files
- **Respect existing structure**: Work with whatever folder structure exists
- **MVP default**: `/docs` folder for generated documents
- **Flexible**: User can override default locations per project

### User's Personal Toolkit Philosophy
**Tool Installation in User's VS Code**
- **Personal augmentation**: Installs in user's VS Code, not in projects
- **Always available**: Tool follows user across any repository
- **One-time setup**: Install once, works everywhere user goes
- **Universal capability**: Same powerful workflow regardless of project type

**Smart Project Detection & Setup**
- **Prompt once per repo**: Remember file output locations per project
- **Detect existing tools**: Check for BMAD, Spec Kit, other frameworks
- **Offer to create**: If no existing structure, ask "Should we create our own?"
- **Brownfield adaptation**: Work with whatever exists or create minimal structure

### Open Source Contribution Workflow
**GitHub Issue â†’ Analysis**
- **Copy-paste GitHub issue** into markdown file
- **Run RAPID-AI scripts** over the issue details  
- **Generate analysis/implementation plan** without disrupting project
- **Contributor-friendly**: Work on any repo without requiring project setup

## ðŸ”´ **RED HAT - Emotions & Intuition**

### Most Excited About
**Personal Toolkit Liberation**
- **Adding to toolkit**: Love AI possibilities for solo developers with many ideas/projects
- **Framework fatigue**: EmberCare has thousands of config files (Spec Kit + BMAD) with minimal actual code
- **Time waste frustration**: Spent tons of time "tinkering with getting AI just right" instead of coding
- **Universal tool**: Work on any project, any language - just open VS Code and be productive

**Consistent AI Interaction**
- **No custom prompting every conversation**: Don't want to roll dice with AI assumptions each time
- **Structured when needed**: AI follows templates and guidelines, not its own random path
- **Predictable outcomes**: Sometimes want AI creativity, sometimes want systematic execution

### Skepticism & Fears
**Technical Feasibility Doubt**
- **VS Code task complexity**: Skeptical about accomplishing the VS Code integration
- **Scope concern**: Might be asking too much technically
- **Implementation fear**: Won't work because it's not possible or too complex to figure out

### Empowerment Vision
**Daily Workflow Fantasy**
- **Open VS Code every morning and just get to work**
- **Tool belt mentality**: RAPID-AI alongside other trusted tools
- **Universal productivity**: Any project, any language, immediate effectiveness

### Industry Frustration
**AI Tool Ecosystem Problems**
- **Many developers failing with scattered AI tools**
- **Marketing noise**: "Experts" pushing next AI feature/model when developers don't care
- **Vendor lock-in everywhere**: OpenAI CLI, Claude CLI, Codex - must buy into each ecosystem
- **Missing universal approach**: Need tool that works across all AI services

### Confidence Building Needs
**VS Code Task Uncertainty**
- **Key concern**: Can VS Code tasks actually follow across projects?
- **Current experience**: EmberCare tasks are local only, didn't follow to new project
- **Confidence booster needed**: Proof that global VS Code tasks are possible

### Ideal Emotional Experience
**Invisible Integration**
- **Tool belt follows everywhere**: Part of VS Code itself, always available
- **Flow state priority**: Don't think about AI, think about code
- **Native VS Code feeling**: Like Git integration or Copilot tab completion
- **Cognitive invisibility**: Tool disappears, focus stays on actual development
- **Effortless**: Just another VS Code feature, no mental overhead
