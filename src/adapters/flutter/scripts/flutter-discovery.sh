For this Flutter story using BLoC + Drift architecture, provide:

1. **Story Requirements Summary**
   - Core functionality needed
   - User acceptance criteria
   - Business rules and constraints

2. **Drift Table Definition**
   - Complete table schema with proper column types
   - Relationships and foreign keys
   - Enums and custom types needed
   - Migration considerations

3. **BLoC Events/States Required**
   - Event classes for user actions
   - State classes for UI representation
   - Error states and loading states
   - State transitions and business logic

4. **UI Components to Build**
   - Page/screen structure
   - Widget hierarchy
   - GruvBox Dark theme integration (if applicable)
   - Accessibility considerations

5. **Testing Approach**
   - Unit tests for BLoC logic
   - Widget tests for UI components
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - Test data and mocking strategy

6. **Implementation Files List**
   - Specific file paths in lib/ structure
   - Dependencies to add to pubspec.yaml
   - Code generation requirements

Keep response concise, actionable, and specific to Flutter/Dart patterns."

## Flutter-Specific Reminders

### After Creating/Modifying Drift Tables
```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Dependencies Check
Ensure these are in `pubspec.yaml`:
- `flutter_bloc` for state management
- `drift` for database
- `equatable` for value equality
- `get_it` for dependency injection

### Architecture Patterns
- Follow BLoC pattern: Events â†’ States â†’ UI
- Use repository pattern for data access
- Inject dependencies via get_it
- Keep business logic in BLoCs, not widgets

### Testing Requirements
- Test BLoCs with `bloc_test` package
- Mock repositories with `mocktail`
- Test widgets with `flutter_test`
- Verify database operations with test database

### File Structure (EmberCare Pattern)
```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/           # DI, routing, theme, utils
â”œâ”€â”€ data/           # Database, repositories
â”œâ”€â”€ domain/         # Entities, enums (pure Dart)
â”œâ”€â”€ presentation/   # BLoCs, pages, widgets
â””â”€â”€ main.dart       # Entry point
```

### Code Generation Reminder
Always run after schema changes:
```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
