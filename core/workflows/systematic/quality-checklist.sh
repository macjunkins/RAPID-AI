# Development Quality Checklist

## Instructions for Developer

Before marking work as complete, go through each item in this checklist. Mark items as [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, or [N/A] Not Applicable and provide brief comments if necessary.

## Requirements & Functionality

- [ ] All functional requirements are implemented as specified
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met and verifiable
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions are handled gracefully
- [ ] Functionality has been manually verified by running/testing the application

**Comments:**

## Code Quality & Standards

- [ ] Code follows established coding standards and conventions
- [ ] Code is well-structured with appropriate separation of concerns
- [ ] Complex logic is documented with clear comments
- [ ] No hardcoded values that should be configurable
- [ ] No obvious security vulnerabilities (input validation, error handling)
- [ ] No new linting errors or warnings introduced

**Comments:**

## Testing

- [ ] Unit tests implemented for new functionality
- [ ] Integration tests added where appropriate
- [ ] All tests pass successfully
- [ ] Test coverage meets project standards
- [ ] Tests cover both happy path and error conditions

**Comments:**

## Build & Dependencies

- [ ] Project builds successfully without errors
- [ ] Linting passes without issues
- [ ] No new dependencies added without justification
- [ ] New dependencies (if any) are documented and secure
- [ ] Environment variables and configurations are documented

**Comments:**

## Documentation

- [ ] Code is self-documenting with clear naming
- [ ] Complex algorithms or business logic are commented
- [ ] User-facing changes are documented (if applicable)
- [ ] README or setup instructions updated (if needed)

**Comments:**

## Integration & Compatibility

- [ ] Changes integrate properly with existing codebase
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs or interfaces
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained where required
- [ ] Performance impact assessed and acceptable

**Comments:**

## Final Verification

- [ ] All tasks and subtasks are marked complete
- [ ] Implementation decisions are documented
- [ ] Any technical debt or follow-up work is noted
- [ ] Ready for peer review and testing

**Developer Signature:** _______________  **Date:** _______________

**Overall Assessment:**
- [ ] Ready for Review
- [ ] Needs Additional Work (explain below)
