# Phase 4 Complete: Legacy BMAD Cleanup

**Date:** 2025-10-24  
**Objective:** Remove the remaining BMAD-branded assets and tooling so RAPID-AI operates with RAPID-only source material.

---

## What Changed
- Deleted legacy directories `.bmad-core/` and `.bmad-infrastructure-devops/`.
- Removed one-time migration helpers (`scripts/transform-templates.py`, `scripts/debrand-tasks.sh`).
- Tightened `scripts/validate-structure.sh` to fail if any BMAD branding slips into `dist/.vscode/`.
- Pruned `bmad:*` scripts and keyword from `package.json`.
- Updated roadmap, documentation guidance, and distribution notes to reflect the RAPID-only workflow.

## Verification Evidence

| Check | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RAPID tasks present | `ls src/rapid/tasks | wc -l` | `27` files (includes `DE-BRANDING-SUMMARY.md`) |
| RAPID templates present | `ls src/rapid/templates | wc -l` | `15` files |
| RAPID checklists present | `ls src/rapid/checklists | wc -l` | `7` files |
| RAPID workflows present | `find src/rapid/workflows -type f | wc -l` | `6` files |
| Legacy branding | `grep -R \"BMAD\" dist/.vscode/` | No matches after cleanup |

---

## Documentation Updates
- `CLAUDE.md`: Documentation workflow guidance now references EmberCare production patterns and emphasizes RAPID-only branding.
- `README.md`: Roadmap reflects the Phase 4 cleanup focus and removes premature CLI installation messaging.
- `READY-TO-DISTRIBUTE.md`: Notes that legacy `.bmad-*` directories have already been removed from the workspace.
- `WIP.yaml` and `WIP-SESSION-2025-10-23.yaml`: Phase 4 marked complete with updated verification details.

## Next Steps
1. Phase 5 â€“ expand documentation (architecture overview, dual-mode guidance).
2. Keep `AGENTS.md` aligned with the updated `CLAUDE.md` baseline.
3. Defer npm/CLI distribution work until the later release phase as planned.
